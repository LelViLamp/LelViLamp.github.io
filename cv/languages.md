🇩🇪 | **German**   | L1    | This is my first language (L1). I grew up with my family speaking dialect but I am not (yet) able to speak it. I would love to learn it but as I am rarely at home these days it is far more likely that I will acquire a different dialect in the meantime.
🇬🇧 | **English**  | C1/2  | Most of my life and the media I am exposed to is in this language. There is a notable decline in vocabulary and grammatical correctness since I have started learning Italian.
🇮🇹 | **Italian**  | B2/C1 | Level depending on the capacity in question (reception / production / written / spoken). Most of this was self-taught using [a self-contained book](https://www.langenscheidt.com/shop/italienisch/selbstlernen/sprachkurs/langenscheidt-fit-in-30-tagen-italienisch-978-3-12-563489-3?c=745), apps ([Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/LelViLamp) and [Memrise](https://app.memrise.com/user/LelViLamp/)) and exposure to the language in Italy. During my exchange year to Padova and Rome, I did formal courses at university.
🇯🇵 | **Japanese** | N5    | This did not work out that successfully in the self-taught manner. While I do not care about making mistakes in Italian, I am a perfectionist in Japanese -- I do not want to offend anyone -- which holds me back from getting the exposure and experience I would need to foster the knowledge I gained over the last 4 to 5 years.
🇫🇷 | **French**   | N/D   | Course started in 03/2022 as I do understand a lot thanks to Italian and I just speak as much as my limited active vocabulary allows.
🐻 | **Russian**  | A1/2  | Courses from my Bachelor's at uni claim I have a B1 level. Certainly not having used it at all for years, my production is < A1 by now but sometimes I understand more than I would have expected.
