                This is my first language (L1). I grew up with my family speaking dialect but I am not able to speak it. I would love to but as I am rarely at home these days, it is far more likely that I will acquire a different one in the meantime.

            <td>
                Most of my life and the media I am exposed to is in this language. There is a notable decline in vocabulary and grammatical correctness since I have started learning Italian.

                Level depending on the capacity in question (reception &lrarr; production; written &lrarr; spoken). Most of this was self-taught using a <a href="https://www.langenscheidt.com/shop/italienisch/selbstlernen/sprachkurs/langenscheidt-fit-in-30-tagen-italienisch-978-3-12-563489-3?c=745" target="_blank">self-contained book</a>, apps and exposure to the language in Italy. During my exchange year to Padova and Rome, I took formal courses at university.

                Course started in 03/2022 as I do understand a lot thanks to Italian and I just speak as much as my limited active vocabulary allows.

                This did not work out that well in the self-taught manner. While I do not care about making mistakes in Italian, I am a perfectionist in Japanese ﹣ I do not want to offend anyone, which holds me back from getting the exposure and experience I would need to foster the knowledge I gained since 2016.

    I am a proud user of language apps. You can follow me on some of them. Also, I am always happy for language tandems.
