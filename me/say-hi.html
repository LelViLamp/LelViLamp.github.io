<h2>Options of Saying <em>Hi</em></h2>
<p>
    You have various options of saying <em>hi</em>, indeed. The first and simplest one is just sticking with <em>hi</em>. You can replace it with a friendly <em>hello</em> but also a <em>good day</em> is appreciated. Given that <a href="/cv/languages">I do speak a couple of languages</a>, why not try <em>hallo</em> or <em>servus</em>, which is perfectly fine in southern Germany and Austria also in some formal contexts. Or we can continue further south and transition to a gentle <em>ciao</em>.

    You are still here even though you have just learnt about your options of saying <em>hi</em>? Well, why not practise your freshly gained skill by:

    <ul>
        <li>writing an e-mail to <a href="mailto:daniel.goeller@proton.me">daniel.goeller@proton.me</a>;</li>
        <li>finding me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goeller" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Daniel_Goeller7" target="_blank">XING</a> and dropping a message there.</li>
    </ul>
