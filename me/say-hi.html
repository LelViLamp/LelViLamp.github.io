<h2>Options of Saying <em>Hi</em></h2>
<p>
    You have various options of saying <em>hi</em>, indeed. The first and simplest one is just sticking with
    <em>hi</em>. You can replace it with a friendly <em>hello</em> but also a <em>good day</em> is appreciated. Given
    that <a href="/cv/languages">I speak a couple of languages</a>, why not try <em lang="de">hallo</em> or
    <em lang="de">servus</em>, which is perfectly fine in southern Germany and Austria also in some formal contexts.
    Or we can head further south and transition to a gentle <em lang="it">ciao</em>.
</p>
<p>...</p>

    You are still here even though you have just learnt about your options of saying <em>hi</em>? Well, why not practise
    your freshly gained skill by:

<ul>
    <li>writing an <a href="mailto:daniel.goeller@proton.me">e-mail</a>;</li>
    <li>finding me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgoeller/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and dropping a
        message there.</li>
</ul>
