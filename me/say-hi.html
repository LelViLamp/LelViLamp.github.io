<h2>Options of Saying <em>Hi</em></h2>
<p>You have various options of saying <em>hi</em>, indeed. The first and simplest is just sticking with <em>hi</em>. You can replace it with a friendly <em>hello</em> but also a <em>good day</em> is appreciated. Given that I do speak a couple of languages, why not try <em>hallo</em> or <em>servus</em>, which is perfectly fine in southern Germany and Austria also in some formal contexts. Or we can continue further south and transition to a gentle <em>ciao</em>.</p>
<p>Please do note that I will take your choice of language as an invitation to reply in that language (<a href="/cv/misc">if I know it</a>, that is). If you were not to wish for that, please do let me know.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
    You are still here even though you have just learnt about your options of saying <em>hi</em>? Well, why not practise your freshly gained knowledge by:

    <ul>
        <li>writing an <a href="mailto:daniel.goeller@protonmail.com">e-mail</a>;</li>
        <li>stalking me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goeller" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Daniel_Goeller7" target="_blank">XING</a> and dropping a message there.</li>
    </ul>
