## <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', courier;">Hello World</span>

 👋 Nice to meet you! My name is Daniel G&ouml;ller, I am a Data Scientist with a passion for languages and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>. I shall find a way to smith my personal Triforce of computer science, linguistics and psychology. My pronouns are (the paradigms of) _he_ and _they_. I also believe that anyone in the business who has some self-respect should hate all the programmiung languages and frameworks.

💻 I currently work at a <abbr title="business to business">B2B</abbr> company in search optimisation and work quite a bit with <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>. It is fun but can be, as every job in IT sometimes is, frustrating.

🎓 I love education and am curious about a lot of things. I've go a Master's degree in Data Science with a dissertation on <abbr title="Named Entity Recognition">NER</abbr> on historic German texts from the 18<sup style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: super;">th</sup> century. It was a fascinatingly interesting project but I'm quite genuinely glad it's over. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Psychology. A field I'm still interested in and am passionate about. During my studies, I did an Erasmus semester, or three, thanks to which I found a passion for languages.

▶️ [Have a look at my CV](/cv/) for details on the things I've been doing in my life so far.

🤙 I am always interested in working on new projects, acquiring knowledge, connecting and finding out what other people (= you) are doing. So, [do get in touch](/me/say-hi) for a chat. Also in case you'd just like to have some <a href="/cv/languages">language tandem/exchange</a>.

<span lang="ja">よろしくお<span title="願【ねが】">願</span>いいたします。</span> <span lang="is">Gama að kynnast þér.</span>
