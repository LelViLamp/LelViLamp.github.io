## Options of Saying _Hi_

You have various options of saying _hi_, indeed. The first and simplest is just sticking with _hi_. You can replace it with a simple _hello_ but also a _good day_ is appreciated. Given that I do speak a couple of languages, why not try _hallo_ or _servus_, which is perfectly fine in southern Germany and Austria also in some formal contexts. Or we can continue further south and transition to a gentle _ciao_.

Please do note that I will take your choice of language as an invitation to reply in that language. If you were not to wish for that, please do let me know.

...

You are still here even though you have just learnt about your options of saying _hi_? Well, why not practise it by:

- writing an [e-mail](mailto:daniel.goeller@protonmail.com);
- stalking me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goeller) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Daniel_Goeller7) and dropping a message there.

For first contact, these are the options I am comfortable with sharing publicly. Once we got to know each other a bit, we can switch to other ways of contacting or even call as I am in possession of a cordless telephone.
